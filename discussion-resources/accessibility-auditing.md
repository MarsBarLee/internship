# Resources for accessibility auditing

From February 3, 2022 discussion.

## Resources on how to audit and test accessibility

- [Tetralogical - Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/)
    - Isabela: a personal favorite resource! Gives a good range of tasks for manual testing.
- [Deque - What to look for in an accessibility audit](https://www.deque.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-an-accessibility-audit/)
    - Isabela: a good high-level overview an audit techniques and potential focuses.
- [Government of South Australia - Accessibility auditing](https://www.accessibility.sa.gov.au/introduction/audits)
    - Isabela: this resource may give you ideas in a step-by-step way. Many government sites have good, straightforward resources like this one even if they are focused on a different area than our work.

## Examples of auditing/audits

Including some resource closer to our work. Please note there is no expectation to use any one of these (very different) auditing styles as a template for your own. The goal is to give you different types so you can decide what's best suited for your research.
