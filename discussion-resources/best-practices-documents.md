# How to write a Best Practice Document
Learning from others to help write our own.

## What is the purpose of a Best Practices Document?
- Definion of best practices: 'A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means OR because it has become a standard way of doing things'
- Why document best practices?
  - Centralize information in a permanent place
  - Clarify assumptions
  - Onboard newcomers

## How does a Best Practices Document differ from other documents?
- Example: a cookbook on making soup step-by-step is a diffferent document from a chef's employee handbook on navigating a commerical kitchen
- Another way we can understand different types of doucmentation is through [the diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)

## Examples of Best Practices Document
- Everyday examples
-   Instruction manuals on how frequently to clean your new appliance
-   Student handbook on how to wear the uniform and expected behabiors
- Accessibiltiy best practice documents such as [WCAG's page on color contrast, 'Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)'](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)

## Looking at Best Practice Documents
With reference to [WCAG's page on color contrast, 'Techniques and Failures for Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)'](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
### Organization
- Quick summary at top of page
- Why/Motivation/Current problem for users
- Rationale for these best practices/How did we decide on these as best practices?
- Bullet point summary of actions that can be taken
- Links the lead to more detailed explanation how to execute each best practice

### Scope
- People with visual disabilities
  - 'People with low vision'
  - 'person does not see the full range of colors',  'individuals who see no color'
  - 'loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision'
  - 'People with more than [vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision] usually use assistive technologies to access their content'

### What's Included? What's not Included? Why?
- The Tetralogical document '[Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/)' mentions 'people with reading disabilities, such as dyslexia' as people who also benefit from the best practice of colour customisation. The WCAG's page on color contrast does not mention these users.
