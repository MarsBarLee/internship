# Document Outline Ideas

Note from Isabela: Finding varied, quality resources and/or examples 
for this topic has been tricky. This list is going to be a work in 
progress. It may come to listing our own ideas here, too.

- [Basic structure and types of scientific papers - PubMed.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18695858/)
     - May have sections we like, like our discussion around having a Methods section.
- [Guide for documenting and sharing best practices - WHO](https://www.afro.who.int/sites/default/files/2017-06/Guide_for_documenting_and_Sharing_Best_Practice_-_english_0.pdf)
     - The best practices format is listed in Section 5 (bottom of page 7) in the PDF
     - A practical guide with good ideas about evaluating what something needs to be a best practice.
