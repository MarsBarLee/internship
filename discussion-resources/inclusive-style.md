# Resources for inclusive writing style guides

## What is a style guide?

When writing, [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) are the set of standards people choose to follow in terms of tone, voice (as in active or passive), formatting, and word choice. There are many style guides, all used at different scales and sometimes different industries.

When writing regularly, this can help writers and reviewers have shared expectations. It may also remove the guesswork around words or grammar that have multiple corect methods.

For this project, we don't have a singular style guide, but it may help us to review other style guides for support when we have questions.

## Why write inclusively?

What we write impacts the world around us and its power structures. If we want to create spaces in open source that welcome and empower more people, this is an important step. 

## Inclusive style guide references

- [Inclusive UX Writing- Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/inclusive-ux-writing/). The style guide for Adobe's design system. Everything under the Language and Inclusivity section is relevant here.
- [Write Inclusive Documentation- Google's Developer Documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).
- [Inclusive Language - 18F](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language/).
- [Gender-Inclusive Language Style Guide - City of Madison Wisconsin](https://www.cityofmadison.com/mayor/apm/hr/APM2-52Attach2.pdf). The Forms and Demographics section has information that none of the other resources do as well as some good examples of what not to do.
- [Radical Copyeditor](https://radicalcopyeditor.com/blog/). (Though it is not a single style guide, it dives into specific topics well. Mostly U.S.-focused.)
