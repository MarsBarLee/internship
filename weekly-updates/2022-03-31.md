# Weekly Updates for March 31, 2022
Meeting topics: Review Audit Draft, Preparing for Volunteer Meetings, Post-Volunteer Meeting Dicussion

Notes taken in [#24](https://github.com/isabela-pf/internship/issues/24).

## Updates from this week:
### Swast, Isabela and T upcoming meeting
- Rescheduled to next week.
- To ask
  - What kind of information do you think will help you build more accessible RTC tools?
  - What tasks do you commonly do in a notebook? Which of these tasks do you want to collaborate on or how?
  - Skip auditing!
  - Add some more general collaboration questions
  
### Follow-up from meeting with N
#### How was it leading a user interview?
- Felt a little nervous. Follow script closely vs open vs middle
Did Swast feel adequately prepared with mentor's help? Such as working together to create the Notion page 'Meeting Agenda with N' and linking to [How to Conduct User Interviews](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/user-interview).
- Agenda gave direction, reviewing before
- Better experience than personal projects, such as Goodreads project. Called designers, friends
- Also good agenda with G, review shortcuts before meeting, Learning with previous meeting with E

#### What was interesting or surprised you in the meeting?
- N said difficulty with text- Swast can understand, expect. But surprised, about liking podcasts
- Seeing how people use different formats (text vs sound)
- It's a lot of work to make recommendation for accessibility, whether a report or organize a conference 
- Can write about other disabilities

#### How we'll anonymize the information, as N said her conference organization work and work with L can be identifiable information.
- vs credit
- We could keep that information in the private notes, and in the public notes only include N's experience with RTC tools.
- Or we could keep the conference work (answer for Qn: How you make broad recommendations, such as accessibility for conferences, when disability and accessibility is so individual?) but ask N and L about if and how that part be cited
- Follow-up with N with decision before publishing public notes on Github
  
#### Still need to be careful about anonymization- while can use initials, some people have more easily identifiable information. So may remove this information for public notes.
- Mars to cleaned-up notes in Notion in anonymous but public format, send Noa the Notion document to review, if good, upload on Github

### Swast update
- Finished writing [audit report](https://five-space-ce8.notion.site/Audit-Report-Draft-5a473dd44480453eaa63e8a2fd2b092c)
  - Mentors can look at later to review
- Started User Journey diagrams in Figma
- Can highlight, bold 'this section will have the audit results here'
- What is the purpose of 'Opinion' section?
  - Can be more personal, we recommend doing more research on Area X in the future
  
## Discussion/resource topics:
### Linking to raw data collected vs analyzed data
- Example: [jupyter-resources/notebook-research](https://github.com/jupyter-resources/notebook-research)
- Look at how language is used, first vs third person

## What are you planning on working on next?
- Mars, Isabela to review, comment Swast's report
- Swast to continue writing rest of report
- Isabela to reschedule meeting with T
- Mars to clean up notes with N, message N about anonymize

## Proposed topics/to-dos we did not cover this week:
