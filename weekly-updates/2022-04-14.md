# Weekly Updates for April 14, 2022
Meeting topics: Review Draft

Notes taken in [#31](https://github.com/isabela-pf/internship/issues/31).

## Updates from this week

- The [draft](https://www.notion.so/Best-Practices-for-Accessible-Real-Time-Collaboration-Draft-ee043e54be364707a763e8c8cd2303e9) has arrived! Hooray!
     - There are a few more sections to add, will update on slack as added
     -  Can review what's there now if wanted (Isabela will)
- Swast shares the WIP user journey and asks if there's anything to add.
     - Possibly links and/or further accessibility notes, but overall looks good
     - It will need an image descriptions
     - Should this stay as a link or be embedded through notion somehow? We do know how to make the image more accessible, so that will probably be what we do.
     - Should we do journeys for each user we did this with? Short answer, yes if it is not too time consuming. This could be a great way to give a concrete and easy to summarize the collaborative research.
          - Duplicate existing one, and do versions for collaborative tests as a concrete takeaway for the tests
          - Is there something we can do for the non-collaborative test volunteers to get a concrete takeaway?
- Question: do we keep the audit report in the whole draft, or link out?
     - Isabela thinks it doesn't feel overwhelming in the document, so she'd keep it there until it seems like the rest of the document is too long. 
 - How to manage time with overlapping tasks?
      - Mars might have advice here! Let's follow up with her.
