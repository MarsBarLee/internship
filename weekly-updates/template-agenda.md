# Weekly updates - template agenda

While these meetings are not so formal as to need a whole agenda, here are some ideas of useful topics to cover and things to remember.

1. Say hello
2. What has changed in the last week? What have you worked on?
3. Celebrate anything that has gone well!
4. What are you planning to work on next?
5. Do you have any questions for someone on the team? Do you need any help from someone on the team?
6. Will anyone be out of office in the next week? Any other scheduling conflicts?
7. Anything else?
8. Time for any learning/larger discussion (time permitting)
