# Weekly Updates February 3

**Today's topic: Scope and accessibility auditing/manual testing techniques**

Notes taken in [#2 on the internship repo](https://github.com/isabela-pf/internship/issues/2).

## Meeting notes

End goal of write-up
- Does not need to recommend very specific things (Does not need to say "use Key X to run Command Y'"
- Perhaps write some 'Guiding Principles' that are broad so that future developers could apply to different scenarios not mentioned in write-up

We could start doing accessibility auditing/manually testing of some RTC tools
- Try out basic functions, such as open a document, read the document, resize it, etc
- 10 test you could do, from this article, '[Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/)'
- A video of some people auditing '[Auditing Websites for Accessibility (with Anna E. Cook) | Some Antics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjX91QlgW-g)'
- More resources linked at '[Resources for accessibility auditing](Resources for accessibility auditing)'

We could also scope by assistive technology
- [List of assistive technology](https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/assistive-technology) 
- Screen-readers are most commonly discussed, but not only ones

We could scope by focusing on one RTC instead of a few
- Such as only auditing Google Docs

We could give a specific task to report back next
- Audit Google Docs using the 10 tests from this article, '[Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/)'

Discussion on auditing
- Limitation: our audits as non-disabled users are not the same as disabled users
- User testing with disabled users: Isabela will ask about funding to pay disabled users
- Ideally, we would have user testing with disabled users. However, if we currently do not have time or funds, we can start bridging the gap by auditing as non-disabled users 

Discussion on fear
- This topic has a lot of gaps of information
- However, even absence is useful- it tells us what's missing

Discussion on feeling overwhelmed
- Very understandable, especially since accessibility is a very broad topic
- Us mentors respect you searching and learning! But don't have to look everywhere at once
- Let us mentors know how we can help, maybe give information in a more spread out way or give specific tasks to narrow down

## Next steps

Everyone
- [ ] choose topic/learning for next week (optional)

Isabela
- [ ] do we have a user testing budget?
- [ ] getting a grasp on the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) (Isabela outreach, then bring to larger group)

Swast
- [ ] think if there's anyone you'd like to meet during the internship (optional)
- [ ] accessibility audit (of some kind, based on resources) on one piece of RTC software
- [ ] sort through [WCAG]() standards and label them as `RTC problems` and `Independent of RTC` so we can scope some accessibility areas we are not worried about

Mars
- [ ] be the One In Charge next week
- [ ] keep being cool
